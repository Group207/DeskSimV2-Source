This repository contains the prototype of DeskSim v2, developed as a final graduate project by: 

- Thomas Arinesalingam
- John Ole Bjerke
- Endre Heksum
- Henrik Markengbakken Karlsen


The Norwegian Train Driver Academy, Lokførerskolen, is a vocational school part
of The Norwegian Railway Directorate, educating locomotive drivers. As a part
of the education they use DeskSim, a software developed in-house to simulate
operating a train. DeskSim is built upon jMonkeyEngine, a Java-based game engine
developed in 2003 that has recently become outdated in some areas. To avoid
irrelevancy, Lokførerskolen have started their long-term project of changing game
engines. We were therefore tasked to initialize the long-term goal of migrating the simulator
to Unreal Engine 4.

The code is written in C++ and documented with Doxygen. All code in [/DeskSimV2/Source/DeskSimV2/](Simulatorutvikling/tree/main/DeskSimV2/Source/DeskSimV2) is written by the group's members.
